First flight
============

1. Make sure that the drone was on a level surface when you executed the
   ``deploy`` program, and that you have not rotated it since. If not, please
   run the ``deploy`` program again. Otherwise the drone will try to correct
   for the rotation on takeoff, which may lead to a crash right away.
2. Open http://192.168.1.1/ in your web browser, you should see the GoDrone
   web user interface. But don't expect too much, it's not pretty yet.
3. Connect a gamepad to your computer. Right now the only tested model is this
   `PS3-style controller

   (please share your results of using other controllers).
4. Press the B0 button (X) to turn on the engines.
5. Move the right joystick up / down to control thrust.
6. Use the left joystick to control the roll and pitch angle of your drone,
   allowing you to fly in any desired direction.
7. Press the B0 button (X) again to turn off the engines.

----------

First of all, congratulations, you've earned the dubious badge of honor for
having tried out version |release| of a drone software, made by amateur
robotics enthusiasts, that you just found on the interwebs! You're a truly
adventurous person.

Take all the time you need to recover from this experience, but if you feel
hungry for more, please start to get involved with the :doc:`community`. Report
your experience, share your problems or demand your money back.
