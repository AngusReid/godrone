Building from source
====================

OSX & Linux
-----------

Before getting started:

* Installed the latest version of `Go <http://golang.org/doc/install>`_ (1.2 as
  of writing this)
* Configure a ``$GOPATH`` (e.g. via adding ``export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"`` to
  your ``~/.profile``)
* Add ``$GOPATH/bin`` to your ``$PATH`` (e.g. via adding ``export
  PATH="${GOPATH}/bin:${PATH}"`` to your ``~/.profile``)

Run the commands below to make sure you're in good shape::

    $ go version
    go version go1.2 darwin/amd64
    $ go env GOPATH
    /Users/felix/code/go
    $ echo "${PATH}"  | grep -q "$(go env GOPATH)/bin" && echo "good" || echo "bad"
    good

Next, you will need to setup Go for cross compiling to Linux/ARM. Luckily this
only takes a minute. The fastest way is this::

    $ cd $(go env GOROOT)/src
    $ GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm ./make.bash --no-clean

If this doesn't work for you for some reason, you may try to follow Dave
Cheney's `guide for cross compiling Go
<http://dave.cheney.net/2012/09/08/an-introduction-to-cross-compilation-with-go>`_
instead.

With Go installed and ready, download GoDrone::

    $ dst="$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/felixge"
    $ mkdir -p "${dst}"
    $ cd "${dst}"
    $ git clone git@github.com:felixge/godrone.git
    $ cd godrone

Now you should be ready to build godrone and upload it to your drone::

    $ make

Windows
-------

Building on windows is probably also doable, but has not been attempted yet.
Please contribute to the docs if you get it working.
