# godrone

An open firmware for the [Parrot AR Drone
2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_AR.Drone#AR.Drone_2.0_.282012.29)
written in Go.

## Roadmap

* Navdata reader
* Kalman Filter
* Motor Drivers
* Stable Flight / Hover
* AT protocol (enough for compatibility with node-ardrone)
* Video protocol (enough for compatibility with FreeFlight app)
* Http protocol
* Fun hacks

## Motivation

* Learning: A good excuse to dive into robotics algorithms.
* Docs: Document the AR Drone hardware/software interfaces.
* Curiosity: Can this be done in a garbage collected language?
* Community: Non-programmers should be able to download and run this firmware.
